Thesis about the relationship between small market capitalization and accruals during 1988â€“2013

Earnings quality and quality differences in its' sub components - accruals and cash flow - have been
one of the most studied problems in financial accounting. In previous studies accrual component has 
been proved to be weaker quality than cash flow component and this information has been exploited in
stock picking. According to studies a hedge strategy which takes a long (short) position which have 
less (more) accruals has provided positive abnormal returns. Later this phenomenon has been known as
accruals anomaly. Also market capitalization has been associated with abnormal returns which is known
as small market capitalization anomaly. Small market capitalization anomaly says that investing in
companies which have small market capitalization generate higher abnormal returns than investing in
companies with large market capitalization. These both anomalies have been in contradiction with the
efficient market hypothesis which says that markets correctly value all the information and every stock
are correctly priced at the market all the time and mispricing should not be happening.

The purpose of this thesis is to study the relationship between the accruals and small market capitalization 
anomaly. The main research question is that if the accruals anomaly seems to be stronger in small 
market capitalization companies than in large market capitalization companies which could explain 
the small market capitalization anomaly. Briefly said the purpose of this study is to find out if the
both anomalies are the one and same anomaly.

In this study the data was retrieved from the Compustat and CRSP databases from the years 1988 to
2013. In this thesis the research methods used were regression analysis and hedge tests. In the
first part of this study regression analysis was used to find out if the earnings quality and its'
accrual component have been better quality in small market capitalization companies than in the
large market capitalization companies and to provide empirical proof for the quality differences in
different market capitalization companies. In the second part of this thesis hedge tests were used to 
discover the interaction between the accruals and market capitalization to stock prices by dividing the
companies according to accruals and market capitalization.

According to the regression results the earnings quality has been weaker in small market capitalization
companies than in the medium but at the same level as in the large market capitalization companies.
Accordingly the accrual component of the earnings has been better quality in the medium and large market 
capitalization companies than in the small market capitalization companies. According to the hedge tests
of this thesis the accruals anomaly and the small market capitalization anomaly have been weaker during the
years 1988-2013 than in the previous studies related to these anomalies. According to the hedge tests the
market capitalization seems to have interaction which would explain that the small market capitalization
companies seem to provide higher abnormal returns than large market capitalization companies. Although 
according to the hedge tests the accruals component of earnings do not seem to completely explain the small
market capitalization anomaly and the anomaly is also determined by other factors.
